# ✍️ Musings


## Impermanence to purpose
When I was twelve, I suddenly realized how short and fragile life is — the moment someone I deeply cared about left my life. That early sense of impermanence made me obsessed with understanding how humans might live longer, healthier lives. Technology felt like the only path powerful enough to make that happen. Since then, I’ve approached learning with intense curiosity, always trying to explain the world through first-principles thinking, asking questions again and again until I truly understand.

## Hacking systems beyond code
As an undergraduate, I spent seven months building a bioinformatics software entirely from scratch — teaching myself Java, protein-network algorithms, and computational biology without guidance. This tool ([BNMatch2](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/bnmatch2)) became the conceptual foundation for my [first top-tier computer vision publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10447), ultimately helping me win my Ph.D. offer. The “hack” was realizing knowledge from a completely different field — protein information flow — could be transferred into AI semantics modeling.

## A moment that reshaped my path
I have strong public-speaking abilities. During my undergraduate years, I stood on stage at lunchtime — when the whole school was around — to give an English campaign speech. That moment led to me being selected as one of 30 student representatives for a leadership program at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

## Choosing conviction over certainty
I turned down a guaranteed graduate school admission after my bachelor’s degree, which caused confusion and disagreement from my family and peers. I moved alone to Shenzhen to pursue my academic dream as a research assistant at CUHK(SZ). Despite the uncertainty and lack of support, I produced my first research paper — something even senior lab members had not achieved. This taught me resilience and conviction in my own path.

## What I’m known for
I specialize in solving technical problems with strong intuition, creativity, and first-principles reasoning. Peers often see me as someone who can distill a complex system down to its core mechanics and identify the most essential breakthrough point.
