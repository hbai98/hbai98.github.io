# ✍️ Musings


## Impermanence to purpose
At twelve, I learned how abruptly life can change when someone I loved disappeared from my daily orbit. That shock didn’t make me cynical; it made me restless for answers. I became consumed with the question of how we could sustain longer, healthier lives, and technology felt like the most audacious tool available. Ever since, I’ve treated every topic as a puzzle to be disassembled, interrogating first principles and asking the extra question that people usually leave unspoken.

## When curiosity outruns exams
In Chinese high school, everything revolved around the gaokao (高考). I never cracked the top scores, but I was the student haunting the teachers’ office, asking my physics teacher why gravity feels like an invisible glue binding particles. That instinct to chase first principles — instead of test hacks — soaked up time and showed in my scores, even as teachers called me the hardest worker in the class.

With more practice I learned to play the exam game, yet I never matched the naturals who vaulted into the most resource-rich colleges. The system’s promise of equal opportunity matters, but it can flatten curiosity in the process. I still hope we can keep fairness while making more room for students who can’t stop asking why.

## Hacking systems beyond code
During undergrad, I spent seven months building a bioinformatics platform by myself — no advisor, no syllabus, just a stubborn curiosity. I taught myself Java, protein-network algorithms, and enough computational biology to launch [BNMatch2](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/bnmatch2), an open tool that would later inspire the semantics modeling in my [first top-tier CV publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10447). The real breakthrough wasn’t the code; it was the realization that insights from protein information flow could be smuggled into AI, proving disciplines talk to each other if we force the conversation.

## A moment that reshaped my path
One midday in college, I climbed on stage and delivered an English campaign speech while the entire campus milled around with trays of food. It was audacious and a little chaotic — and it worked. That moment led to my selection as one of thirty student representatives for a leadership program at The Wharton School, validating that ideas travel further when you’re willing to voice them in imperfect settings.

## Choosing conviction over certainty
After graduation, I declined a guaranteed spot in graduate school. Family and friends questioned me, but I packed for Shenzhen anyway to work as a research assistant at CUHK(SZ). I lived with the uncertainty, pushed through, and authored my first research paper before many senior lab members published theirs. That experience rewired how I evaluate risk: I now trust conviction more than consensus.

## From papers to products with AI
During my PhD at HKUST(GZ), I kept seeing research constrained by narrow setups, resource-heavy experiments, and results that cracked under real-world pressure. Watching tools like Cursor automate coding made the pattern clear: in fast-moving fields like AI, a paper can be leapfrogged within months. Spending half a year for one top-tier publication is an achievement, but the next release often eclipses it.

I came to believe most of that work is 90% engineering polish that automation will absorb. The opportunity is in the remaining 10% — taste, design, and judgment — and that’s where business lives. I spent the next half year building [HoloSoul](https://holosoul.ai) from scratch as a real product, not a PDF: system software aimed at customers, revenue, and durability. That pivot convinced me I’d rather build companies that survive contact with the world than chase citations that don’t.

## What I’m known for
Colleagues describe me as someone who disassembles complex systems until only the critical gears remain. I lean on intuition, creativity, and first-principles reasoning to hunt for the leverage point — the single insight that shifts the entire problem. That reputation keeps me accountable to the craft of deep thinking.
